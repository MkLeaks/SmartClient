# SmartClient
1.8 Client based on alot of other clients

# Note before using this
This client has some bugs and some modules are broken.
I would recommend to use this as a base.
Oh yeah and this was made in 2020 but i updated it
and made it public.

# Libraries needed to run this
Download them from here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/ct1dq7a4f745i5s/smartlibraries.rar

# "Client not compiling"
The client right now is unable to compile on my side, I don't know if this is a issue because i moved files around or because of updating Log4j because of the CVE.
I am gonna try to fix it, until then use the latest released version, but be warned that is vulnerable to tha CVE until I manage to compile and release the version with latest Log4j.
